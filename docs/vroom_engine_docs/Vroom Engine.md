The vroom engine is intended to be both a gameboy emulator and a toolbox of modules for developing on ESP32 with zephyr. 
## [[Gameboy Emulator]]
Plays gameboy roms off an SD card(one day). Also plays off real cartridges (probably never)

## [[Utilities]]
These are to be designed with the intention that they can be reused easily in other ESP32 zephyr apps.

## [[Games]]
These are just fun, but they also provide building blocks for other lvgl guis.

## [[Subsystems]]
The subsystems are similar to the utilities, but are more specific to the device format.
- On-device display
- Button inputs
- Connectivity (WIFI, Bluetooth)
- Non-volatile storage
- SD Card
- Basic mono audio

## [[Hardware]]
